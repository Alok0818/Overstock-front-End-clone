# Overstock_Website_Clone

<p>
      This is clone of Overstock.com, where we have used HTML, CSS and
      Javascript to acheive this. In this project we have tried to clone the
      “Overstock” website. We had build up all our efforts to do our best in
      this project. As, the Masai School's Mentorship was specifically to build
      up our skills and we also accordingly implemented all that teachings in
      our project to look it at its best.
